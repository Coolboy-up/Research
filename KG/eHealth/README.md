# Building Chinese Biomedical Language Models via Multi-Level Text Discrimination

This repo introduces **eHealth**, a Chinese biomedical language model pre-trained from in-domain text of de-identified online doctor-patient dialogues, electronic medical records, and textbooks.

eHealth is trained from scratch with a new self-supervised generator-discriminator framework. The generator is used to produce corrupted input and will be discarded after pre-training. The discriminator, which is the final target encoder, is trained via multi-level discrimination: (i) **token-level discrimination** that detects input tokens corrupted by the generator and selects original signals from plausible candidates; and (ii) **sequence-level discrimination** that further detects corruptions of a same original sequence from those of the others.

## Download

eHealth discriminator shares identical architecture with [ERNIE Base](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/ERNIE/tree/repro/ernie/model), and can be simply employed by replacing the model file. Our pretrained checkpoint can be downloaded via the following link:

## Benchmarking

We provide eHealth's performance on [CBLUE](https://github.com/alibaba-research/ChineseBLUE) (Chinese Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark, which is composed of 8 diversified biomedical NLP tasks, ranging from medical text classification and matching to medical information extraction and medical term normalization.
